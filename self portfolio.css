		<p class= Introducing myself I am Jorlie Ann T. Perlada, an IT student whose mantra echoes the timeless wisdom:"Time is Gold".
            Born on November 08,2003,in Barangay Lapu-Lapu Santa,Cruz Marinduque, I embodies the essence of seizing every moment with purpose

            value of time in my pursuits. With each endeavor, I aims not only to excel but also to make the most of every opportunity,mindful 
            of the precious resource that is time. My journey is marked by a steadfast commitment to maximizing my potential and making meaningful
            contributions to the IT realm, all while honoring the adage that time,indeed,is Gold.</p>
